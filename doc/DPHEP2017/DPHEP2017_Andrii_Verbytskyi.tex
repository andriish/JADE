\frame{\frametitle{MPP model for DPHEP}
{\bf Data preservation is about  new and interested results with old data.}\\
{\bf In the case of JADE the Data Preservation model and the experince has an extreame importance as well.}
We describe  ingredients and tools:
\begin{columns}[c]
\column{0.4\linewidth}
\begin{itemize}
\item Data bits
\item Software
\end{itemize}
\column{0.6\linewidth}
\begin{itemize}
\item Experiment documentation
\item DP policies and  documentation
\end{itemize}
\end{columns}

\begin{itemize}
\item But in the end we are interested in {\bf physics }.
\end{itemize}
Brief idea: enable physics and make it doable with modern methods in modern environments with minimal effort.\\
}



\frame{\frametitle{MPP model for documentation preservation and policies}
MPP data preservation relies on the documentation preserved by DESY/DESY library/InSpire.\\
The main idea is to provide the missing or DPHEP@MPP-specific documentation:
\begin{itemize}
\item Access to data in MPCDF (H1 and JADE).
\item Monte Carlo generation procedures, event display usage, database of data samples, virtual machine usage (JADE). 
\end{itemize}

The policies on the data/documentation access  are same as in DESY: defined by collaboration spokespersons.

}


\frame{\frametitle{MPP model for software preservation}
Explicit effort put to make software it work in the next 10-15 years.
\begin{itemize}
\item Rely on industry, not HEP-only standards.
\item Enable integration and compatibility with new physics software, e.g. data bases and Monte Carlo generators.
\end{itemize}
no recompilation of software, but frozen environment that can be installed on virtual or real machine is provided:
ISO image of full operating system relying on Intel $x86$  architecture.
Though not implemented, same approach is applicable to H1.

}






\frame{\frametitle{JADE data bits in MPP}
\begin{itemize}
\item JADE data are stored in MPCDF on locally accessible tapes and in disk pool.
\item Access via multiple protocols with grid tools worldwide to disk pools.
\item Grid-enabled storage for new samples (Monte Carlo) and analysis is available.
\item Straightforward procedure to update or add new samples.
\end{itemize}
}


%\footnote{Because of data reshiffling now H1 data temporary is only on tape}	


\frame{\frametitle{JADE data in MPP: Bits statistics}
Data is simple ROOT and PAW ntuples, ASCII files and FPACK compressed data.

\frame{\frametitle{JADE software porting quest}
Source codes were written in  Fortran IV (1974), Fortran 77, Sheltran, Mortran,
  Assembler.
Later these were ported to IBM xlf fortran.  

The original OS/hardware  was UNKNOWN for  on IBM/370 (offline) and Nord 10S/50  (online).
Later  it became AIX 4.3 on RS6000.


}

\frame{\frametitle{JADE software porting quest: step one}
After downloading the tarbal with software from 2003:


One has to find big endian machine, something RS6000 (ppc) compatible.

Solution is QEMU2.7 virtual machine with ppc/ppc64 support. 
Another option, old  RS6000 machine used as router turns out to be slow and has not enough disk space.
RS6000 are availbale on e-bay, but are quite expensive.


One has to find modern big endian OS, something AIX43 compatible.
Solution is CentOS7.2 with multiarch support ppc64+ppc(64be+32be) from CentOS AltArch repository. 

One has to find xlf compatible compiler.
Solution is a trial version of xlf 15.1 from IBM.
Thanks, IBM!

Now we can try to compile something!
}

\frame{\frametitle{JADE software porting quest: step one}

One has to have a build system for the software. Old makefiles are impractical.
Solution is the new cmake. cmake is PERFECT for fortran. 


The fortran dialect incompatibilities are fixed by hand or with sed scripts. 
These are mostly HOLLERITHs, INTEGER to CHARECTER conversion and so on.
Takes some time, but is a straightforward procedure.
{\bf At this point everything compiles. }

One has to link programs with some CERNLIB routines.
Subquest: compile 32 bit CERNLIB for CentOS7 on ppc.
With some tricks 32 bit CERNLIB rpm package was obtained. 
See explanations in the backup.

{\bf At this point executables are linked and tested.}
At the next step gfortran was used to compile the executables.
{\bf At this point  the stup is complitely open source.}
Next, the CentOS7 x8664 with multiach support wasused instead of the  ppc version.
The byteorder issues are solved with gfortran runtime which accepts big endian byteorder I/O if to set a proper environment variable.
export GFORTRAN\_CONVERT\_UNIT='big\_endian;native:2' 
The CERNLIB was compiled for this planform as well.

{\bf At this point  the setup can be used on many standard machines, only 32 bit libraries and  CERNLIB is required.}

}


\frame{\frametitle{JADE software porting quest: step one}

CERNLIB is not supported, so it is a good idea to throw it away.
The main dependence on cernlib are  just few generic routines and HIGZ package for graphics.

The generic routines were copied from cernlib and the graphic primitives were replaced with ROOT 
drawing routines. The small set of routines was collected to form  "picocernlib".% can be compiled even in 64 bit mode.

{\bf At this point  the setup can be used on many standard machines, only ROOT is required.}

\frame{\frametitle{The MC recipe ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
\item Instruction to generate events with old JADE generators are prepared.
\item An interface to modern HEP event records based on HepMC3 libray is developed.
  JADE MC  can be produced from with modern MC generator, e.g.\ NLO capable SHERPA+BlackHat.
\item ZMCSP (JADE Monte Carlo Standalone Package) is a tarball with  all the software needed for the reconstruction
of MC simulated events. It has no external dependencies, runs on modern Grid clusters, virtual machine, a laptop.
On the Grid it can produce 50-100M events\footnote{JADE has 360M of data events} per week. 
Supplemented with example of scripts and documentation.
%\item The first two samples were generated this summer. See Iurii's talk.
%It was found that the key to success is to {\bf read and follow the instructions}.
%\item There is a lot of computing resources around, where it is possible to generate even large samples.
%20-50-100M events is NOT a problem. 
%\item In practice the generation with new MC generators is not much complicated, however only tiny samples were produced with
%SHERA 2.2 and blackhat 0.9.9.

\section{What other experiments can learn from JADE DP}


\frame{\frametitle{Software}
\begin{itemize}
\item Usage of generic technologies for hardware and OS, i.e. IBM mainframes, AIX is important.
\item High code quality, clarity and stability is a key to succees.
Note: some routines are from 1978, i.e. almost 40 years old. 
Few moden experiments can be sure that more than tiny fraction of their code will behave like that.
\item Design of software is important, even complicated things like event display can survive for 30 years if to use good simple approaches, i.e. graphic primitives in this case.
\item good build system makes porting much easier
\item Standartisation of I/O data formats is important.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Data}

\begin{itemize}
\item Compressing the data might look like a good solution, but it is bad. Saving 1Tb of disk space today mean lose of days to read the data back tommorow.
\item Keeping reference data is important.
\item Standartisation of I/O data formats is important.
\item Obvious: EBCDIC is bad.
\end{itemize}
}



\frame{\frametitle{What other experiments can learn from JADE DP: Some anecdotes}
\begin{itemize}
\item one important „calibration“ file, containing the recorded 
  luminosities of each run and fill, was stored on a private account
  and therefore lost when DESY archive was cleaned up
\item   Jan Olsson, when cleaning up his office in ~1997, found an old ASCII-printout of the JADE luminosity file.
  Unfortunately, it was printed on green recycling paper - not suitable for scanning and OCR-ing.
  A secretary at Aachen re-typed it within 4 weeks.
  A checksum routine found (and recovered) only 4 typos.
\item an old version of the original BOSlib 1979 version was found, on
  our request, at the Tokyo computer centre.
\item  Peter Bock, when cleaning out an old lab at the Physics Institute
  at Heidelberg University, found a few 9-track tapes containing
  original JADE MC files which were very valuable for validating
  results of our first re-analyses in ~1997
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{What other experiments can learn from JADE DP: Some anecdotes}
\begin{itemize}
\item first port attempt in 2016 was done with AIX 4.3 machine used as router in MPP.
\item Byte ordering problem is solved in the modern gfortran
\end{itemize}
}
