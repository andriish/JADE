C
C MARK   ->  WHICH 'MARK' OF TAGGER - 1 = 1981,2
C                                   - 2 = 1983 ONWARDS
C
C IFLMRK ->  SET TO '1' BY TAGMRK
C
C IMC    ->  SET TO '1' BY TAGMRK IF MC DATA
C
C CATAG  ->  CONTAINS THE ADC CONTENTS UNPACKED FROM ATAG
C
C SADC   ->  COMMON FOR ADC'S AFTER SORTING  (SORT 1)
C
C CMAP(I,1...9) ->  ADDRESS OF ADC'S IN CLUSTER I,SORT23 PUTS THESE IN

C CAND(3) ->  X, Y, AND ENERGY OF A FOUND CLUSTER IN AFTER CLSPS
C
C SIGX,SIGY,SIGEN ->  ERROR ON X, Y, AND ENERGY AFTER CLSPS
C
C CLUS(9,2) ->  ADC ADDRESS AND CONTENTS OF CLUSTERS - SORTED BY ENERGY
C
C NCLST   ->  NUMBER OF CLUSTERS THIS END
C ISTMZ   ->  POINTER TO START OF -Z DATA IN CATAG ( ALWAYS  1       )
