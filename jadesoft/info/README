Explanation of the files
========================

lumi.dat.ori:    

 Contains the  JADE luminosities integrated in
 consecutive runs with same cms energy (run periods).
 The numbers were manually transfered from Olsson 
 historic printout of the program 'TAKLUMI'

lumi.dat: 

 Like lumi.dat.ori, but with the following modifications:
 1. Tabulators are replaced by blanks.
 2. '0.0'-entries have been brought to the format of
    the other entries.
 3. The missing run periods 540-564 and 581-591 were 
    added in the head of the file. The corresponding 
    luminosity numbers were retrieved from the very 
    first page of the TAKLUMI printout where they are
    given with an accuracy of 4 digits.

jaderun.dat.ori: 

 Contains an overview of the beam energies vs.
 data taking period and run period.

jaderun.dat:

 Like jaderun.dat.ori, but in a format more suitable to
 be processed by a kumac. In addition, the following lines 
 were corrected:

   1985   13.03  13.03  24801 24803    17.536  18
   1985   22.03  22.03  24961 24970    16.500  18

shutdown.dat:

  Contains the shutdown periods.

taklumi.f:

  A FORTRAN program to read the original JADE luminosity files, i.e. the
  luminosity vs. run information. It was modified to read the file
 'lumi.dat' that contains the luminosity vs. run period data.

  N.B.: Checksums from Olssons fax are only reproduced exactly if 
        the given run periods corresponding to these checksums 
        match the run periods in the present luminosity file.
