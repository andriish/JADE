This directory contains a test suite for the JADE software:
 - ``FPTOBOS_1_CLEANUP`` cleanup any remnants of the tests.
 - ``FPTOBOS_1`` will convert JADE sample data into BOS format.
 - ``pythia8_HepMC3_MC1`` will produce events in HepMC format using Pythia8 MC generator.
 - ``HepMC3_CPROD_MC1``   will convert the events generated  by ``pythia8_HepMC3_MC1`` into CPROD format accepted by JADE software.
 - ``MCJADE_MC1``   will produce BOS files from the  CPROD  files generated by the ``HepMC3_CPROD_MC1``.
 - ``SUPERV_MC1``   will run on the output of the previous test.
 - ``ZE4V_MC1``     will run on the output of the previous test.
 - ``JZREAD_MC1``   will run on the output of the previous test.
 - ``JTJOB_MC1``    will run on the output of the previous test.
     
  Please note that many tests require Fortran runtime that supports endianess conversion (e.g. ``GNU`` or ``Intel``).
  
  The directory ``cards`` contains all the steering cards for the used programs.
  The directory  ``src`` contains source files for the Pythia8 main program.
  The firectory  ``jadetapes`` contains a small data file used for the tests.
